/**
 * Keeping canvasOS the home screen on firmwares that pin Home to their own launcher, without
 * disabling any system app. Ported from Aerial (github.com/pengchujin/aerial-tv, MIT), whose
 * per-model notes record what these firmwares do:
 *
 * - Xiaomi PatchWall accepts `set-home-activity` and the HOME role, yet Home still resolves to
 *   `com.mitv.tvhome` (a whitelist only the system can write). Disabling PatchWall leaves the TV
 *   on a black screen, because the fallback home refuses third-party launchers too.
 * - Xiaomi force-stops every third-party app on standby, and Android then drops the app's
 *   accessibility services from the enabled list. It also switches ADB debugging off on wake.
 * - TCL refuses any APK that declares HOME unless TCL signed it (the "guard" flavor declares
 *   none), and blocks third-party apps from starting at boot unless two TCL app ops allow it.
 *
 * The pieces:
 * 1. [HomeGuardService], an accessibility service that brings canvasOS back the moment the stock
 *    launcher comes to the front. It sees window changes only, never screen content.
 * 2. [RevivalListener], a notification listener. Android rebinds a listener about half a second
 *    after its process is killed, which restarts canvasOS; canvasOS then switches the guard back on,
 *    which needs WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS. It reads no notification unless the user turns on banners
 *    ([Banners]) for apps they choose, and then only those apps' title and text.
 * 3. WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS and the listener approval come from adb (a computer, AGENTS.md) or from
 *    the TV's own adb through [LocalAdb] ([grantViaLocalAdb]).
 *
 * All of it is off unless [Prefs.guard] is on. On TVs where canvasOS is the real home (Sony, stock
 * Android TV) it is not needed.
